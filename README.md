This is going to be a bot Used in discord to give your music to everyone in one channel


You will need to download 2 things for this Bot to work

1.) Virtual Audio Cable (A.K.A Line or VAC) Click <url=http://software.muzychenko.net/eng/vac.htm>Here to Download</url> (get the trail version the full version costs 25-50 dollars) 


2.) Discord's Desktop Application Click <url=https://discordapp.com/>Here to Download</url>

# <u>Here's how to start</u>

First off you'll most likely need to have two instances of Discord running at once, so you'll be using your browser and your Desktop app. 
The Desktop app is going to need it's preference changed around to take in audio from VAC. To do this you'll need too do the following.

User Settings -> Voice -> Input Device -> Select VAC

Your Application will now be picking up any audio that goes into VAC. From here you'll need to select your source of Audio. I'm writing this bot personally for use with VLC, but you can you use WMP, VLC, and any other Media player that allows you to select an Audio Feed. 

WMP: Open Windows Media Player -> Go to Organize -> Go to Options -> Go to Devices -> Go to Speakers -> Go to Properties -> Select Line 1

VLC: Open VLC Player, select Audio from the upper menu, and pick "Line 1" as its output channel

and for any other Media Player, Just find settings, and find audio output, and select Line 1.

# <u> Here's how to Set up Discord's Desktop Application</u>

Go to User Settings -> Voice -> Select Line 1 and done. 

NOTICE: you need to turn off all sounds that the bot would be getting, so turn "Output Volume" all the way down.

This is the basics of the bot there is a lot more to be added soonâ„¢
